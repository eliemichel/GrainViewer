Augen Light
===========

branch: `level0`

### About

This is an OpenGL 4.5 Core "hello triangle" code using GLFW (to open a window) and glad (to load opengl). It includes the typical folder layout and CMakeLists that I use for larger projects.

The C++ code of the program is located in [`src/AugenLight`](src/AugenLight) and in particular [`src/AugenLight/main.cpp`](src/AugenLight/main.cpp) is a fully commented sample explaining the use of a VBO, a VAO and a shader program to render a dynamic scene.

### About this branch

This project is organized with several branches, so that intersted people can choose a level of advancement of the project and potential options.

*This branch is the simplest one, the first one to check out. ALl the other ones are built on top of it!*

Check out the other branches as well!

### Downloading

This repository contains *submodules* to include the GLFW and glad repositories, so **do not use** the *download zip* button provided by GitHub. If you want a zip, download the [last release](https://github.com/eliemichel/AugenLight/releases/download/lvl0-v1.0/AugenLight.zip). To clone the repository using git, run:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/eliemichel/AugenLight.git
cd AugenLight
git checkout level0
```

If you forgot to use the `--recurse-submodules`, you can get submodules with:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Dependencies

Before building, you may need some additional piece of software depending on your platform.

#### Windows

On Windows, you need [cmake](https://cmake.org/) and Python.

#### Linux

You can install the required dependencies with the following `apt` command line, or something similar on other packet managers:

```
sudo apt-get install python git cmake xorg-dev
```

#### OSX

You should only need [cmake](https://cmake.org/) and Python, but this has not been tested. Feel free to let me know if anything is missing.

### Building

This is a standard CMake project. Building it consits in running:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

You can chose which compiler to use in the call to `cmake`, using the `-G` option. See for instance [`build-msvc15.bat`](build-msvc15.bat) to build for Visual Studio 15 (2017), or the other build files for `mingw` or `gcc`. More easily, you can also just run one of those scripts, it will even get git submodules.

Once CMake has run, you can build the project. You can do it in command line, from the `build` directory:

```
cmake --build .
```

Or you can use the build process of your compiler, for instance running `make` (for `gcc` projects) or openning the Visual Studio solution.

### Running

The executable file is created within the `build` directory, in `src/AugenLight` or `src/AugenLight/Debug` or `src/AugenLight/Release` or something similar depending on your compiler.

### Troubleshooting

When using Visual Studio, if you encounter this error dialog when trying to run the solution generated by CMake:

![Start up issue](doc/images/startup-issue.png)

Right click on *AugenLight* in the solution explorer (right panel, in default Visual Studio window layout) and chose "Set as StartUp Project".

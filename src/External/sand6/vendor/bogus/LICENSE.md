#LICENSE(s)

Different parts of this software are subject to different licenses.
Every source file states clearly which license terms apply to it.

Briefly:

1. The files from the `src/Core` directory implement a sparse 
   block matrix header-only library, named _bogus_. 
    
   _bogus_ is released under the terms of the __Mozilla Public License v2.0__.
    
   This is a weak copyleft license; proprietary software that uses _bogus_ 
   may be distributed without releasing its own source.
    
   See `MPL-LICENSE-2.0.txt` for the full license terms

2. The files from the `src/Extra` and `src/Interfaces` directories implement
   a Second Order Cone problem solver, named _So-bogus_.
      
   _So-bogus_ is released under the terms of the __GNU General Public License__,
   either version 2 or (at your option) any later version.
   
   This is a strong copyleft license; software using _So-bogus_, or linking
   against _So-bogus_, cannot be distributed as non-free (as in freedom) software.
   
   See `GPL-LICENSE-2.txt` for the full license terms
   
3. The copyright to every other file, including the contents of
   the `apps/` and `tests/` directories, is dedicated to the public domain. 
   See the [Creative Commons CC0 information page] [1].
